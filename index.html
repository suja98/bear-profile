    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'm a handsome shy boy very good at eating raw meat.</p>
        <h3>This is my mom, Muc aka "Ink" in English because she's black. She cared about me so much. I'm always her cutest little boy. She's in heaven now. I hope she knows that I love and miss her very much.</h3>

            <img src="./assets/images/Gau3.jpg" height="400" alt="me being taken care of by Mom.">
        <h3>He's my uncle, Thui. I usually let him eat my food because I love him (not because I'm scared of him btw).</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/Thui.jpg" height="400" alt="He's even more handsome than I am. I'm not jealous though">

    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My nana is homeschooling me.</p>

    <h2>Work experience</h2>
        <p>My nana always spoils me, so I never have to work. Obviously I'm her favorite boy.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Looking at my human with my puppy eyes so they will give me sweet as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Hiding in the house while barking at strangers so I won't be kidnapped (btw I'm not chicken-hearted, okay?).</li>
            <li>Sleeping anywhere I find comfortable (I can jump quite high).</li>
            For example:
